# nim
A simple Python implementation of the game of Nim (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

Many, many years ago, I came across a book called "Computers", published by Whizz Kids (https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0356093670). At the time I was just a child, filled with wonder about the promise of computers. On one of the pages, there was a program listing for a game called NIM, written in BASIC, presumably for a ZX Spectrum or similar machine of the era (BBC, Acorn, etc). I excitedly went home and with my Dad, dilligently entered the code into our Atari. Not knowing anything about code, compilers, interpreters or IDEs, once it was entered, we didn't really know what to do with it. We couldn't compile it, we couldn't run it, it didn't do anything. I remember being a bit disappointed and resolving to someday understand it enough to make it work. 

Fast forward many years, while tidying one day I came across the book again. As I flicked through, I came across that old program listing and decided to write it in Python. This respoistory contains a very simple implementation of the game of NIM. It's not my best code ever, but that's deliberate. I wanted to try and follow the procedural nature of BASIC, so there's no functions, no object orientation, just a hacky version of NIM. 

Whether or not it's useful or not I'll leave for others to judge, but I got some long overdue satisfaction from finally making it work :)
